## Description

Iotas is a granular based module taking it's roots from Mutable Instrument's Clouds. It's not fair to call this module a clone or a port, as there is a large chunk of the code missing, and my version is poorly coded. The largest chunk that we're taking from the code is the Granular Processor block.
