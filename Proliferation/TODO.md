# Things to do 
- add clear function
- get a handle on that reverb DONE - needs tweaking - send level? 
- Delay is to costly on resources
- add more knobs for more mangling 
- test backward replay (this is implemented in samplebuffer.h) - this works, but kbuffsize is not the way to go. 


## NOTES
Temporarily removing reverb due to poor audio quality on playback
